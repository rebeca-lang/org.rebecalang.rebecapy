In the sample, we have a python code running a rebeca virtual machine. It runs the actor Car in the port.rebeca program. Within the program the actor opens a port and sends a message to move the car. The message is received on the host virtual machine through a port interface that was passed as a constructor argument. 

The output of running the program is displayed on screan.
